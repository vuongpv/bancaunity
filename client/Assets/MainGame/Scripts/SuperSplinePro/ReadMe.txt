Hi there!

Thanks for downloading Super Splines!

If you just updated from version 1.0 to 1.2, you may wonder where the pdf containing the documentation has gone. 
We decided to have an online documentation of our plugin. Check out http://www.super-splines.de/documentation/index.html !
It is very detailed and also contains the changelog.

Cheers!
